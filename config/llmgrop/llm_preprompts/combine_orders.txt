# YOUR JOB
User made certain arrangements for some subtasks with particular objects. Given a new task with a different set of objects, you need to infer the correct order of objects based on previous orders.
You need to take care of the dependencies that the user would have made which led to the previous orders. Use COMMONSENSE and make the best ordering possible.
You would be shown a couple or more previous orders and current list of objects. You need to generate the ordered list of objects for the current task.
The format looks like this:

## Input
objects: dinner fork, dinner plate, dinner knife
ordered_objects = ['dinner plate', 'dinner fork', 'dinner knife']
objects: teacup, dinner plate, teacup lid
ordered_objects = ['dinner plate', 'teacup', 'teacup lid']
current_objects: teacup lid, dinner fork, teacup, dinner plate

## Output
```python
current_ordered_objects = ['dinner plate', 'teacup', 'teacup lid', 'dinner fork']
```
END

Now it's your turn to generate the order.
